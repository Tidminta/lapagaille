She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but

[sorie de boucle rd = 1679]

without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not

[sorie de boucle rd = 1679]

[main]
to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very

[sorie de boucle rd = 1679]

[main]
ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business

[sorie de boucle rd = 1679]

to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore

[sorie de boucle rd = 1679]

tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked

seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a

rosary round my neck, and said, "For your mother's sake," and went out

for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still

round my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly
